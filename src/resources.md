## OCaml and Functional Programming

Programming assignments for this course use the [OCaml][] language. Here are some [instructions for installing OCaml][install]. (In contrast with that guide, I recommend [Homebrew][] on macOS: just type `brew install ocaml`.)

[ocaml]: https://ocaml.org
[homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[install]: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/install.html

If you are already familiar with another functional programming language, OCaml will be quick to pick up. If you're new to functional programming, however, you might want to spend some time at the beginning of the semester getting up to speed. Here are some resources for learning OCaml:

* [Try OCaml][try] is a tutorial you can follow in your browser.
* [The CS 3110 tutorial][3110tut] is accessible and thorough.
* The book [*Real World OCaml*][rwo] is fantastic and free to read online.
